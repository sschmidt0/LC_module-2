## Exercises

In this repository, you'll find the solutions to 5 exercises:

1. Array operations (using rest and spread operators)
2. Concat
3. Clone and Merge
4. Read Books (with Typescript)
5. Slot Machine (working with a class)

To use Typescript, the package `typescript` was installed as a dev dependency to compile the code into JavaScript. To use this compiler, the script

`"typescript:watch": "tsc exercise-set2.ts --watch"`

was added.
